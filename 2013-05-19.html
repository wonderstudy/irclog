Time  Nick      Message
00:01 pdurbin   Rho?
00:03 sebbu     so, my links ?
00:08 pdurbin   sebbu: merged
00:09 pdurbin   thanks
00:10 sebbu     most of them are about computer science
00:11 sebbu     maybe renaming links to the name of the feed would be better
00:11 sebbu     (for the youtube ones)
00:12 sebbu     I'll try an update later
00:14 sebbu     there's http://gotoandlearn.com/ too
00:14 pdurbin_m sounds good. I need to do the same for some links I added
00:15 pdurbin_m hmm, nice. good emphasis on design
00:15 pdurbin_m maybe we could list "sister sites"
00:16 sebbu     http://gotoandlearn.com/
00:16 sebbu     grr
00:16 sebbu     http://www.codecademy.com
00:26 slystone  'night!
00:28 pdurbin   sebbu: I just gave you push access to https://github.com/wonderstudy/wonderstudy.github.io so you shouldn't need to make pull requests any more. you can just edit if you want
09:52 sebbu     pdurbin, thx, I modified my links
09:52 sebbu     still not sure where I should add codecademy &amp; others alike
11:38 pdurbin   sebbu: much better. thanks!
11:38 pdurbin   yeah, I'm not sure the best way to organize the site
11:39 sebbu     can't help you for that, i'm not sure either
11:39 sebbu     even my bookmarks aren't organized
11:39 pdurbin   good enough for our first week, I think :)
11:39 sebbu     they just have tags
11:39 sebbu     hum
11:40 sebbu     Since I now have push access, I could delete my fork ?
11:42 ubitux    (note: missing /topic)
11:42 pdurbin   ubitux: d'oh!
11:43 ubitux    /topic http://wonderstudy.github.io/
11:43 ubitux    i guess
11:43 pdurbin   ubitux: thanks
11:44 pdurbin   ubitux: I first set the topic at http://irclog.greptilian.com/wonderstudy/2013-05-11#i_6057 but I re-created the channel
11:44 pdurbin   sebbu: sure, no need for your fork. I trust you :)
11:45 pdurbin   hmm, other new people
11:45 ubitux    pdurbin: I'm sorry, but you have no excuse, and I won't tolerate such mistake
11:45 pdurbin   Gardel: welcome!
11:45 pdurbin   JesseH: welcome!
11:45 pdurbin   ubitux: grr! ;)
11:45 ubitux    :)
11:46 sebbu     pdurbin, the logs are 7 days old
11:48 pdurbin   yep, we're just getting started :)
11:57 ubitux    was this project/community motivated by http://i.imgur.com/OXlquzg.jpg btw?
11:57 ubitux    :)
11:57 Gardel    nice pic
11:57 ubitux    (took me half an hour to find it back FFS)
11:57 Gardel    ty
11:57 ubitux    grepping irc logs like shit
12:01 sebbu     it's hard for urls with identifiants instead of useful keywords
12:02 ubitux    and some more: http://www.academicearth.org/ http://oyc.yale.edu/
12:03 ubitux    i think i have some MIT free courses url lying around, but maybe it's already submitted
12:09 ubitux    does anyone want me to make a text version out of the imgur pic?
12:11 Gardel    does ffmpeg include an OCR?
12:12 ubitux    nope, but my brain has an effective one
12:12 sebbu     ubitux, I think it'll be good, but a source better than imgur could be good
12:12 sebbu     I know there's a website with lots of images alike
12:12 Gardel    so I gave you an idea for a new feature
12:12 sebbu     on tons of domains
12:12 sebbu     but i don't remember the url
12:13 ubitux    oh and i don't know if it has its place here
12:13 ubitux    but this is a nice one: http://www.dspguide.com/
12:13 ubitux    a bit too much specialized likely, and well, just a book
12:13 ubitux    but a fairly complete one
12:13 pdurbin   ubitux: here's how this channel started: "with all theses universities providing courses online wouldn't it be nice to have an IRC chan, which could be dedicated to them all ?" -- melodie at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2013-04-18#i_6720792
12:14 ubitux    that nickname tells me something...
12:16 ubitux    http://noexcuselist.com/everything :)
12:17 ubitux    i'm going to make a txt and dump all kind of shit in it
12:17 ubitux    you'll pick what you want from it
12:21 sebbu     http://www.cheatography.com/
12:21 sebbu     http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/ started from here
12:22 ubitux    i hope you guys will write a bot to check for 404 and various other down
12:22 ubitux    to flag the current link db
12:26 sebbu     Maybe there's in the "service hooks" available in the settings, I still didn't checked them all
12:26 sebbu     +one
12:29 ubitux    http://b.pkh.me/ultimate-edu
12:30 ubitux    all of them look up, except gutenburg.org
12:30 ubitux    which is broken here
12:31 sebbu     it's http://www.gutenberg.org/
12:31 sebbu     :)
12:31 ubitux    i see
12:32 ubitux    fixed
12:32 ubitux    anyway; so i'd add dspguide.com and the meta noexcuselist.com/everything ; and possibly the two others i quoted previously http://www.academicearth.org/ http://oyc.yale.edu/ (i have no idea of the value of them)
12:33 ubitux    i'm too lazy to mess with the .md on the git though, so feel free to do it
13:00 pdurbin   thanks for all the links, everyone
14:24 melodie   hello
14:24 melodie   I have caught up the conversation by reading here: http://irclog.greptilian.com/wonderstudy/2013-05-19
14:24 melodie   I have opened the image pointed to by ubitux
14:26 melodie   and wondered if it would be possible to get a text version for the links not yet presented at the github wonderstudy page ? Particularly the links for courses in languages, which might be useful to anyone who would want to take a course in English but is not fluent in then language
14:28 pdurbin   melodie: it sounds like ubitux was offering to make a text version of that imgur pic
14:29 melodie   oh, very good, thank you ubitux!
14:29 pdurbin   ubitux: if you're still willing, I would appreciate it :)
14:29 melodie   pdurbin you didn't finish the configuration here did you? Do you intend to take care of it during the coming week?
14:32 pdurbin   melodie: the chanserv thing? I've never added chanserv to a channel. wouldn't it be enough to make you a founder of this channel? then you could become an op, etc.
14:33 melodie   pdurbin are you going backwards because it's a big work to configure it all? I've been through that before a pair of times. ;)
14:34 melodie   I would prefer you take care of it :)
14:34 ubitux    pdurbin: i did it.
14:34 ubitux    pdurbin: 14:30:09 &lt; ubitux&gt; http://b.pkh.me/ultimate-edu
14:34 ubitux    melodie: aren't you someone from either archlinux or amsn? i think i remember someone from there with your nickname, but that's years ago
14:35 pdurbin   ubitux: oh! I missed that. thanks!
14:41 melodie   hi ubitux yes, Archlinux user
14:42 melodie   ubitux I remember you nick too :)
14:43 ubitux    so i wasn't smoking weed, okay :)
14:43 melodie   O_^
14:43 melodie   lol
14:43 melodie   ubitux how did you land here btw?
14:44 ubitux    some from here leaked a link on another server/channel
14:44 ubitux    someone*
14:44 melodie   pdurbin do you want us to ask help from a freenode staffer ? I had all the commands long ago but they are not in use anymore, it was numbers at that time
14:44 melodie   ubitux which chan was that ?
14:45 ubitux    a semi-private one
14:45 melodie   what is a semi-private chan? o_o
14:45 ubitux    a friendly lost channel
14:45 ubitux    why do you ask? :)
14:46 melodie   ubitux because I am curious
14:47 melodie   ubitux you can visit #linuxvillage too :)
14:47 ubitux    i've enough channels, thank you
14:49 melodie   well try visiting us once a while then, it will be nice!
14:49 melodie   we talk French and English there
14:50 ubitux    really, i've enough channels :)
14:50 melodie   as it suits you :)
14:58 pdurbin   melodie: I'm sure we can figure out the commands. I'm more just curious what your goal is with chanserv or whatever else
15:01 sebbu     well, I posted the site on several channel after melodie posted it on ##programmation
15:02 melodie   pdurbin I look my tutorial and will try to answer your question
15:03 melodie   one thing for sure, ChanServ we be logged in and keep the chan even when I'm not connected there. If someone has trouble with a spammer on the chan and reports to #freenode the staffers can come and act to stop the spammer
15:20 pdurbin   oh, I see... so having ChanServ in here is more for the benefit of the freenode staffers. it's so they can op themselves
15:21 pdurbin   I assumed freenode staffers could simply op themselves in any channel
15:21 sebbu     some (ircops) can
15:21 melodie   pdurbin no
15:21 melodie   it's for the benefit and the safety of the chan
15:21 melodie   and of the users of the chan
15:21 sebbu     chanserv would allow some users to have automatic op for exemple (or right to op themselves)
15:22 melodie   the staffers don't benefit of anything, we do
15:22 melodie   it is just more work for them when they are needed, which they do with lots of good will and very nicely
15:23 melodie   sebbu yes, also, auto op is good
15:24 melodie   sebbu is it chanserv who registers the nickserv commands ? As in "/msg NickServ FLAGS #wonderstudy melodie +V" :D
15:35 pdurbin   slystone: yesterday you linked to http://richard.esplins.org/siwi/2011/07/08/getting-started-freenode-irc/ at http://irclog.greptilian.com/wonderstudy/2013-05-18#i_7272 that says, "You shouldnâ€™t be operator any longer than you have to, as it creates an unhelpful class distinction among channel users and not knowing who is operator can help keep trolls from causing trouble."
15:35 sebbu     no, chanserv and nickserv doesn't really interacts
15:35 sebbu     chanserv just use nickserv to identify the ppl
15:36 sebbu     if they're registered&amp;identified, they have the access they have, otherwise they don't, that's all
15:37 sebbu     flags is on chanserv :p
15:42 melodie   pdurbin I have not considered that part and it does not seem to me that keeping the op ever caused problems on chans where I am logged in, be it the one I created or others
15:42 slystone  pdurbin: oO I've never said that.
15:42 melodie   slystone not you but some of the tutorials do
15:42 slystone  Oh, ok.
15:43 melodie   pdurbin anyhow you can op out as you want
15:43 melodie   any time
15:43 slystone  melodie: I tend to agree it's bs.
15:44 melodie   but once opped out you can't voice someone or just type a "/mode +m" immediatly if a spammer comes in. so you have to remember the @!$Â£Â£## op in command fast :D
15:57 sebbu     you can /cs voice
15:57 sebbu     /cs mode #salon +m
16:24 pdurbin   I have so much to learn about IRC
16:27 melodie   what would be nice additionnally to have ChanServ with the guard on command, would be everyone voiced, however some chans prefer no one voiced, but I don't know why
16:41 melodie   pdurbin I didn't learn much about IRC myself, just did the commands to set it up, and then forgot about them. :D
16:41 pdurbin   melodie: I try to write this stuff down: http://crimsonfu.github.io/2012/02/06/crimsonfu-freenode-irc-channel-setup.html
16:42 pdurbin   but I could be better about it
16:42 * pdurbin heads out. bike parade!
18:51 melodie   pdurbin some limited op rights can be +ARVfiorstv // this is what I gave to someone I wanted to help (and trusted to do so)
18:52 melodie   the right for the founder : +AFORVfiorstv
18:54 pdurbin   hmm
18:55 sebbu     I'm not sure i'ld have put the R
18:56 sebbu     or the s
19:04 pdurbin   melodie: I just gave you the same access I have: +AFRfiorstv
19:04 pdurbin   (not that I understand what all those flags mean) ... :)
19:10 sebbu     /msg chanserv help flags
19:12 melodie   pdurbin what would you want me to do exactly?
19:19 melodie   pdurbin you missed +O : auto op
19:19 melodie   http://www.stack.nl/~jilles/irc/atheme-help/ChanServ.html
19:19 melodie   I look at the rest
19:20 melodie   and +V is useful too, autovoice
19:20 melodie   pdurbin could you add them please?
19:25 pdurbin   melodie: I think you should be able to make these changes yourself now
19:25 melodie   I can't
19:25 pdurbin   melodie: this is what I typed: /msg chanserv flags #wonderstudy melodie +AFRfiorstv
19:26 melodie   I just told you what is needed
19:26 melodie   I can't auto op
19:26 pdurbin   hmm
19:26 melodie   you should add it for yourself too
19:26 pdurbin   melodie: but you can manually op, right?
19:27 melodie   * #wonderstudy :You're not a channel operator
19:27 melodie   can you see what I just pasted?
19:27 pdurbin   hmm
19:27 pdurbin   ok, I was able to make you an op with: /msg chanserv op #wonderstudy melodie
19:28 pdurbin   and I'm able to op myself with: /msg chanserv op #wonderstudy pdurbin
19:28 melodie   thank you
19:28 pdurbin   and deop with: /msg chanserv deop #wonderstudy pdurbin
19:29 melodie   I would suppose auto op allows being op whenever leaving the chan and coming back
19:29 melodie   and same for autovoice
19:29 pdurbin   I suppose it wouldn't hurt
19:30 pdurbin   but I don't do this in any other channel
19:30 melodie   pdurbin what do you think about having ChanServ on guard here? Did you consider it?
19:30 pdurbin   melodie: I don't have any objections. we have the same access. you can set it up if you want
19:33 melodie   done
19:33 melodie   this was "/msg ChanServ SET #wonderstudy GUARD ON"
19:35 melodie   pdurbin do you want auto op for yourself?
19:37 sebbu     autoop is +O
19:38 melodie   sebbu yes
19:39 melodie   I have auto opped myself I was asking pdurbin if he wants me to auto op him
19:40 melodie   the +V flag seems to work
19:41 melodie   slystone have you made your first template yet ?
19:43 melodie   pdurbin you didn't answer, so I auto opped you, if you want to remove the flag, feel free to do it
19:43 melodie   pdurbin philbot is not registered?
20:12 pdurbin_m melodie: no, not registered
20:28 JesseH    hi
20:29 pdurbin   JesseH: hi!
20:30 JesseH    :-)
20:30 JesseH    How goes it?
20:32 pdurbin   fine. the main study going on in the house at the moment is about mealworms :)
20:32 pdurbin   "climby" as she is called by my 6 year old
20:33 JesseH    I don't actually know what all this is :P sebbu brought me here
20:33 pdurbin   :)
20:34 pdurbin   sebbu is helping us with our website: Update index.md with new conferences recorded talks or podcasts Â· f9a18f8 Â· wonderstudy/wonderstudy.github.io - https://github.com/wonderstudy/wonderstudy.github.io/commit/f9a18f838e06722365332572dedcee738e6fd81d
20:45 sebbu     JesseH, educational stuff I told you
20:45 JesseH    that explains so much ;P
20:45 sebbu     just watch the website
20:47 sebbu     pdurbin, there's lots of links to add (from thoses past hours), but i'm not sure how/in which part
20:59 pdurbin   I know. A lot of links! It's great, but how best to organize the site, I wonder
21:03 pdurbin   personally, I prefer audio I can subscribe to with a podcatcher on my phone
21:05 pdurbin   while I've heard good things about Coursera stuff, I'm not sure if I can subscribe to it in that way. and I think you need to "keep up" with the class. you can't just take it at your own pace, listening to lectures here and there as time allows
21:10 melodie   hi again
21:10 melodie   pdurbin I just caught up from the log
21:11 melodie   I was also thinking about some organization for the links I had one or two ideas about it
21:19 pdurbin   oh good
21:20 melodie   pdurbin do you remember this program you have shown to me once? Related to filtering methods with drop down menus?
21:20 pdurbin   hmm... no...
21:22 melodie   I should browse #crimsonfu to seek for it, I suppose but I don't remember what the name for it was
21:22 melodie   or I'll browse my history with wikipedia as filter key word
21:22 melodie   or I try to describe
21:22 melodie   it is methods to classify things
21:23 melodie   does that ring a bell?
21:23 melodie   according to multiple criteria
21:26 melodie   pdurbin !
21:26 melodie   http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_%C3%A0_facettes
21:26 melodie   this one !
21:31 slystone  melodie: well not yet.
21:32 melodie   slystone what are you answering to?
21:32 slystone  Well, to oragnize the links you can just tag them, wouldn't it work?
21:32 slystone  melodie: your question about templates.
21:32 melodie   that's an idea, tags can be helpful
21:33 slystone  melodie: some tools like shaarli do it.
21:34 melodie   in github with it's markdown syntax?
21:35 slystone  melodie: not at all.
21:35 slystone  http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli
21:36 slystone  I'll probably set up one myself.
21:36 melodie   thanks but this is too much reading for me now
21:37 melodie   if you set up one for yourself, and if it is publicly available would you show me?
21:38 slystone  melodie: http://sebsauvage.net/links/ you've got an example here
21:38 melodie   one idea I also had would be to specify who the courses were intended to, with the requirements (level... )
21:39 melodie   and another one would be if the course was interactive or not
21:40 melodie   and thinking about something pdurbin said earlier, let people know where are the courses which can be started at any time in the year and be picked when one has time, and others such as coursera where a course is provided in a limited span of time
21:41 slystone  melodie: and you could add some countdowns. :)
21:41 melodie   slystone like what?
21:42 slystone  A countdown for each course that begins at a fixed date.
21:45 pdurbin   oh, facets. faceted search. yes, think about this all the time now because I'm implementing this feature at work: https://redmine.hmdc.harvard.edu/issues/2656
21:47 pdurbin   yes, facets are kind of like tags, I guess. categories
21:49 melodie   pdurbin do you know any markdown editor which does the job of adding the syntax for the user? I'd like to do some diff between what was posted here by ubitux earlier and what is already published on the github wonderstudy page
21:50 pdurbin   melodie: http://stackoverflow.com uses markdown and has a preview at the bottom, below what you type
21:51 pdurbin   and it has a wysiwyg editor
21:51 melodie   pdurbin what about a gui editor in the system?
21:51 melodie   do you know any?
21:51 pdurbin   yes, gui editor: wysiwyg
21:53 pdurbin   melodie: if you ask in #crimsonfu others might have some good ideas. I'm not exactly sure what you want
21:53 melodie   which can be installed into the computer?
21:53 melodie   ok, no problem
21:54 melodie   I'll search another day
21:54 melodie   http://b.pkh.me/ultimate-edu
21:54 melodie   this contains links which are not yet at github wonderstudy page and some which are already in it
21:55 melodie   it will need a diff I guess
21:56 melodie   and a gui tool would be nice too, to create the links instead of having to type the tags by hand
21:57 melodie   if it's only me, all this will fast end into a wordpress cms XD
21:59 melodie   but I don't know much of github yet, so I probably miss a lot of what exists there
21:59 ubitux    want me to reformat them?
22:00 melodie   ubitux what about forking and sending a pull request containing a diff ?
22:00 ubitux    no i'm too lazy
22:00 melodie   no hurry... you could do that at the right time for you
22:00 melodie   could you at least make a diff?
22:00 ubitux    well it requires some brain to know where to put them
22:00 ubitux    that's the main effort
22:00 ubitux    to the git part
22:01 melodie   diff http://wonderstudy.github.io http://b.pkh.me/ultimate-edu
22:01 ubitux    the question is
22:01 ubitux    where do you put the links into that page?
22:01 ubitux    with what categories etc
22:02 ubitux    i just don't want to think about that
22:02 melodie   don't, just see what we already posted and what is common with your list?
22:02 ubitux    :effort:
22:02 ubitux    i'm busy with other projects
22:02 ubitux    sorry
22:02 pdurbin   ubitux: exactly. where? :)
22:03 melodie   ubitux if you can reformat it to get the links linkable that could help
22:03 ubitux    markdown has some url matching afaik
22:03 pdurbin   to remind us: Add links from http://b.pkh.me/ultimate-edu Â· Issue #2 Â· wonderstudy/wonderstudy.github.io - https://github.com/wonderstudy/wonderstudy.github.io/issues/2 :)
22:04 ubitux    you should add the other links of the day too..
22:04 melodie   good night all
22:04 melodie   see you
23:33 pdurbin   https://blogs.oracle.com/javaspotlight/entry/java_spotlight_episode_128_joe was interesting. I took some notes at http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2013-05-19
