15:08 pdurbin     melodie: hello!
15:10 melodie     hi pdurbin !
15:10 melodie     I am about to try to install openerp 7.0 on Ubuntu Precise
15:11 pdurbin     melodie: I'm thinking about leaving this channel and taking philbot (the bot that logs this channel) with me
15:11 melodie     and Odoo just came out, as the officiel OpenErp replacement. :&gt;
15:11 melodie     what's the point?
15:11 pdurbin     the point?
15:11 melodie     is it a problem for you to administrate here?
15:11 pdurbin     why would I leave? Is that what you mean?
15:11 melodie     yes sir! :)
15:12 melodie     nothing ever happens here: is that why?
15:12 pdurbin     this channel is almost inactive
15:12 pdurbin     yes, exactly
15:12 melodie     would you rather tell the people to go to #freeclass ? and just deactivate here?
15:12 pdurbin     it's spring. I'm doing some spring cleaning :)
15:12 melodie     I meant #free-class
15:13 pdurbin     I'm fine with changing the /topic to recommend #free-class
15:13 melodie     ok, fair enough : let's ask all people here to join #free-class and we can remove this one?
15:13 melodie     yes, please go ahead
15:13 pdurbin     we could also recommend #free-class at http://wonderstudy.github.io and in the header/footer of http://irclog.greptilian.com/wonderstudy
15:14 melodie     sure, I am ok with that
15:14 pdurbin     great. thanks
15:15 melodie     no problem :)
15:15 pdurbin     bike parade with the kids today but I'll probably do all this within a week or so
15:15 melodie     just let me know when it is ready for the big change, so I don't stick here for no reason either, anymore
15:16 pdurbin     heh
15:17 pdurbin     melodie: you'll know when I've change the /topic
15:17 melodie     ok, thanks
15:17 melodie     what about the welcome message too? (entrymsg) ?
15:18 pdurbin     I don't think we ever set that up
15:18 pdurbin     or at least I didn't. I don't know how
15:21 melodie     pdurbin it was " /ChanServ SET entrymsg #wonderstudy pdurbin is about to change things here, stay tuned "
15:21 melodie     pdurbin I had to try different ways before finding the right order in words, and that's it
15:22 melodie     is that ok for you?
15:22 pdurbin     melodie: can you just remove the entrymsg instead?
15:23 melodie     done
15:23 melodie     I did the same with no message at all
15:25 pdurbin     perfect. thanks
15:34 melodie     no problem :)
17:28 * pydsigner watches the chandeath
19:05 pdurbin     lol
19:06 pdurbin     so sad, I know. It was a good experiment
