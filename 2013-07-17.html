21:41 melodie   a sword is a long metallic tool which can slice people in two pieces. :p
21:41 pdurbin   :)
21:42 * melodie in kidding mood
21:45 pdurbin   melodie: you can see if this makes any sense to you: [sword-app-tech] POST atom entry, then PUT media resource - http://www.mail-archive.com/sword-app-tech@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00331.html :)
21:46 melodie   pdurbin not sure I'm in the right stage of mind for it right now, but I can try to look at it
21:47 pdurbin   melodie: if you want
21:47 melodie   I just asked slystone if he could join, because I don't feel good enough in English for this
21:48 melodie   pdurbin anyhow my deep thought!
21:48 melodie   pdurbin anyhow my deep thought:
21:49 pdurbin   :)
21:49 melodie   Any text on the web should start with a brief summary containing in few words the whole content of what will follow
21:49 pdurbin   melodie: if you realy want to talk about SWORD and DVN it's on topic for http://irclog.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/2013-07-17 :)
21:49 melodie   then the reader can choose to read the rest, or have enough with the summary
21:50 melodie   I don't, honestly, I would just like to please you if I can, but I am unsure I can
21:50 melodie   pdurbin would you like to have a wordpress blog ? :D
21:51 melodie   this is a great tool to spread info around in all social tools directions!
21:51 pdurbin   melodie: someone would need to patch it against security vulnerabilities for me ;)
21:52 pdurbin   slystone: welcome!
21:52 melodie   hello slystone !
21:52 melodie   pdurbin could you point to the log at the start of the discussion for slystone to catch up please?
21:52 melodie   pdurbin I vote for security patches!

21:55 melodie   so you can catch up
21:55 melodie   nice if you can do better than I on this one, I'm dead sleeping
21:56 melodie   I went to be almost early in the morning and had to get up just a few hours later for a guy was mawning the lawn! &gt;:||
21:56 melodie   not far from my window, of course!
21:56 pdurbin   melodie: mowing the lawn while yawning? ;)
21:57 melodie   I went to be/ to bed
21:57 melodie   I don't mow lawns
21:57 melodie   I love nature for what it is then I don't use fossile energy for that
21:58 melodie   a neighbour had rent the services of someone to do it for him
21:58 slystone  pdurbin: Well, I've had a look at it. From what I understand it makes sense… but I don't have the knowledge to make any sort of recommandation.
21:59 slystone  melodie: I completely agree for the mowing thing.
21:59 melodie   oh thanks!
21:59 pdurbin   slystone: you looked at the SWORD thing? thanks!
22:00 slystone  If I have a garden later, if there is any mowing to be done, it will be by an animal, or a hand tool.
22:00 slystone  pdurbin: but like I said, I don't know the project nor the technology, just a lil bit of curl. :3
22:00 melodie   pdurbin I invited slystone to ask help from him to try to give you some interesting feedback, for my brain right now looks just like melocotton
22:01 melodie   for what I can remember that would be a smooth, soft, very tender fruit?
22:01 melodie   slystone there are some very good hand tools some need a flat soil, others don'
22:01 melodie   don't
22:02 pdurbin   melodie: a peach, looks like
22:02 melodie   ok!
22:03 pdurbin   slystone: +1 for knowing curl :)
22:03 melodie   have to go, good evening and night!
22:06 slystone  pdurbin: what would you say is the main advantage of curl?
22:07 slystone  I use mostly rsync (well, all the time).
22:15 pdurbin   slystone: oh. um. they are different tools
22:15 pdurbin   curl is for pretending you're a web browser, kinda :)
22:16 pdurbin   rsync is a fancier scp :)
22:24 slystone  OK :)
22:31 pdurbin   :)
22:35 slystone  I should have a look at it, but I'm translating a speech by Eben Moglen. ^^
22:36 slystone  Eben Moglen ♥
22:39 pdurbin   slystone: they mentioned him at http://5by5.tv/inbeta/56 but it was clear they didn't know who he is
22:43 slystone  XD
