22:22 pdurbin   I was thinking more about online university computer science courses vs. audio content from technical podcasts and conferences
22:22 pdurbin   I like both for sure
22:23 pdurbin   the courses are for the fundamentals
22:23 pdurbin   it's the ivory tower
22:23 pdurbin   the stuff from podcasts and conferences is about the day to day work
22:23 pdurbin   it's from the trenches
22:23 pdurbin   both are valuable
22:24 pdurbin   in general, it's not always easy to find university courses about the specific software stack you're using
22:24 pdurbin   but it's often not hard to find alternative audio that covers that niche
22:25 slystone  Hi pdurbin
22:45 slystone  Hi pydsigner &amp; pdurbin
22:45 pdurbin   pydsigner: hi!
22:46 slystone  pdurbin: pydsigner is from Freenode, I've explained our little problem. ;)
22:46 pydsigner Is everyone in-channel active?
22:46 pdurbin   yes
22:47 pydsigner OK, everyone leave, and then slystone should come back
22:47 slystone  ok
22:47 pydsigner soulshake TechDesk Goodbox pdurbin
22:47 pydsigner See above
22:48 pydsigner Also the bots will need to leave
22:48 slystone  pdurbin: do you want to be founder, or should I do it?
22:48 pdurbin   slystone: doesn't matter. I can do it if you prefer
22:48 slystone  pdurbin: ok, I'll let you do it.
22:48 pydsigner You can give founder, too
