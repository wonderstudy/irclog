Time  Nick      Message
21:26 melodie   hi
21:26 pdurbin   melodie: hi!
21:26 melodie   pdurbin ?
21:27 pydsigner Yeah, we're waiting for the staff conference to end
21:27 melodie   the only one who can't logout is TechDesk because he is logged in from his home and is not returning there before tomorrow evening GMT+2 : tomorrow evening he will be able to quit from here
21:27 melodie   ok
21:28 melodie   pdurbin am I needed here?
21:28 pdurbin   melodie: while you were away erry said this channel we started looks to be on-topic for freenode
21:29 melodie   what does this mean?
21:29 melodie   "on-topic for freenode" ?
21:30 pdurbin   melodie: "As a program of a not-for-profit entity, freenode was established to provide resources to specific communities for activities which advance the public good." -- http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#ontopic
21:30 pdurbin   that's my understanding anyway
21:32 pydsigner Could TechDesk log in from where-ever he is right now?
21:32 pdurbin   melodie: I would say we are trying to advance the public good :)
21:32 pydsigner He could grab back his nick, then quit.
21:32 pydsigner I guess you have to contact him first :-/
21:33 pdurbin   pydsigner: poor TechDesk. it's my fault for not registering this channel right away
21:33 melodie   pydsigner I just asked him on another chan #cyber-tux, I hope he could get the message
21:33 pydsigner OK
21:34 pydsigner Shoot, he has the HideMail flag
21:34 melodie   he was in as TechDesk__ : but he quit
21:34 melodie   so this will be tomorrow evening
21:34 pydsigner So we can't send him an email easily
21:35 melodie   he will be back at his home tomorrow... he told me we can count on him to come right on here to logout
21:38 melodie   pdurbin I just read what "on-topic" is
21:38 pdurbin   melodie: do you think we are on topic?
21:38 melodie   then I guess #linuxvillage also is on-topic (we are registered, so no problem there)
21:38 melodie   yes I do
21:38 pdurbin   good. me too :)
21:38 melodie   I didn't know about that page until now
21:38 pdurbin   melodie: do you want so say a few words about what this channel is about?
21:39 pdurbin   earlier I said, "we share information about free online university courses and similar educational audio and video (conference talks, podcasts, etc.)"
21:39 pdurbin   and I pointed out our website: http://wonderstudy.github.io
21:39 pdurbin   melodie: thanks for the updates to the website, by the way :)
21:39 melodie   the present channel is about learning online of all kinds, courses, opencourseware, videos and helping each other finding the right courses as well as having direct help to learn better: is that all correct?
21:39 melodie   pdurbin did you like what I added?
21:46 pdurbin_m yes
21:46 melodie   thank you!
21:48 pdurbin_m you were able to edit from the browser, right?
21:49 melodie   yes sir
21:50 pdurbin_m good. hope it was easy
21:50 melodie   yes, I followed the example of your method
21:50 melodie   just mimic
21:51 melodie   I noticed the preview tab, and the code tab...
21:51 pdurbin_m monkey see, monkey do :)
21:51 pydsigner Hehe
21:53 melodie   I have read that somewhere, isn't it the first words of a programming course?
21:53 pdurbin_m it's how I code... :)
21:56 melodie   nice
21:56 melodie   it makes me happy to think that soon it will be possible to learn faster thanks to this one channel
21:57 melodie   with the people helping each other around specific questions
21:57 pdurbin_m yep
21:57 pydsigner Is text format stuff desired also, or just multimedia?
21:58 pdurbin_m sure
21:59 melodie   pydsigner I don't understand the question
22:04 pdurbin_m melodie: at http://wonderstudy.github.io we emphasize audio and video, not text
22:05 pdurbin_m which I think is valuable. text is easier to assess if it is any good or not
22:06 melodie   I just scratch my head
22:06 melodie   let me re read the page
22:06 melodie   perhaps I'll come to understand
22:07 melodie   pydsigner do you want to try to explain me?
22:07 melodie   I re read and still don't get it... :-(
22:08 melodie   &lt;pdurbin_m&gt; melodie: at http://wonderstudy.github.io we emphasize audio and video, not text
22:09 melodie   where do you see that we emphasize audio and video ? the links don't show what they lead to, do they ?
22:09 pydsigner Hmm, I don't see it anymore
22:10 pydsigner I was readying pdurbin's comment, "we share information about free online university courses and similar educational audio and video (conference talks, podcasts, etc.)"
22:10 pydsigner * reading
22:11 pdurbin   audio is what I like. I wish I had more time to watch videos and read but I often don't :(
22:11 pdurbin   melodie: I would say we are trying to emphasize free content, wouldn't you?
22:12 melodie   yes, this is it
22:12 melodie   and the most important I think is the interactive free courses, because they make the learning more attractive
22:12 pdurbin   pydsigner: so if the text is free, if it's just out there, sure, I would link to it
22:12 melodie   than just reading docs and pdf books
22:15 pdurbin   melodie: I think recommendations are important. in ##programming last night someone was asking for free courses to watch. http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-033-computer-system-engineering-spring-2009/ was mentioned and the person asked, "have you watched it? is it good?"
22:15 pdurbin   and the reply was, "yes, it's good, though I've only watched a little. it covered linking very well."
22:15 melodie   and did you answer this last question?
22:15 pdurbin   nope
22:16 pdurbin   but
22:16 melodie   who did?
22:16 pdurbin   I added "covers linking" to http://wiki.greptilian.com/podcasts
22:16 pdurbin   since I already had that course listed there :)
22:16 melodie   what is covers linking?
22:16 pdurbin   now I'm more motivated to watch it!
22:16 pdurbin   this is linking: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_%28computing%29
22:16 pdurbin   "covers" just means "talks about"
22:17 pdurbin   linking is discussed in that course
22:18 melodie   pdurbin is that what the prelink program does?
22:18 pdurbin   hmm, well, I think prelink loads stuff in memory so it loads faster
22:19 pdurbin   from the man page I would say it *is* related
22:19 pdurbin   hence the name :)
22:19 pdurbin   if you compile software by hand you'll see object files
22:20 pdurbin   which get "linked" together into the binary that you execute
22:20 pdurbin   the binary could be a command, such as grep
22:20 melodie   then...
22:21 melodie   I try to figure out what the libs become when I uninstall a program which it has been linked to
22:21 pdurbin   melodie: have I confused you? I'm sorry
22:21 melodie   I suppose as long as it is shared with another program nothing happens ?
22:21 melodie   no you have not
22:21 melodie   you just brought me to thinking of the inner life of these programs
22:22 pdurbin   some objects are shared. seeing foo.so is common. "so" stands for "shared object"
22:24 melodie   oh good
22:24 melodie   so so ! :D
22:25 pdurbin   :)
22:26 pdurbin   comme ci, comme ça
22:27 pdurbin   "so so" :)
22:30 melodie   did you copy paste your "ça"? You are supposed to not have the ç on your US qwerty keyboard :D
22:30 pydsigner Lol
22:31 melodie   pydsigner he is very clever! ^_^
22:32 pdurbin   I cheated. I copied it. I have a "normal" keyboard ;)
22:32 melodie   lol
22:34 melodie   you can get it from your keyboard too probably. This would be how:
22:34 melodie   in the console, you would type "setxkbmap fr"
22:34 melodie   then hiit the key 9
22:34 melodie   once done to get your keyboard again, type setxkbmap us
22:34 melodie   done
22:34 melodie   and 0 would produce a 'à'
22:34 pdurbin   ç
22:34 pdurbin   zoz
22:34 pdurbin   i mean ... "wow"
22:34 melodie   ^_^
22:35 melodie   with the keybaord under Linux we can also have accents on high case
22:36 melodie   À Ê È É
22:36 pydsigner It didn't work for me :(
22:36 pdurbin   seems like so much trouble
22:36 melodie   and special characters such as Œ œ æ Æ
22:36 pdurbin   who needs all those accents? ;)
22:36 melodie   to say "eggs":
22:36 melodie   œufs
22:36 melodie   under Windows not that nice:
22:36 melodie   oeufs
22:37 melodie   see? The former one is the right way to type it
22:37 melodie   about the online courses
22:37 melodie   I have registered to the cs50 mailing list
22:37 melodie   and a guy posts to ask about how to install a table for special characters, because he is French and can't type the signs : [r(
22:37 melodie   signs:
22:38 melodie   [{ and ] }
22:38 melodie   he just didn't know that under Linux we just need to use the Alt-gr key for that
22:38 pydsigner That would be a problem!
22:38 pdurbin_m melodie: have you noticed how international the cs50 mailing list is?
22:38 melodie   once I had explained: he didn't need to install a table of characters anymore!
22:38 melodie   yes I did
22:41 melodie   there are many people who start with "I am not very good in English..."
22:42 melodie   with the right setup we can do fun things with the keyboard
22:42 melodie   “” : en quotes
22:42 melodie   «french quotes»
22:42 melodie   signs such as →
22:42 melodie   …
22:42 melodie   ↓
22:42 melodie   ←
22:43 melodie   ↑
22:43 melodie   ™
22:43 melodie   ⁽™⁾
22:43 melodie   ©
22:43 melodie   Â
22:43 melodie   ¢
22:43 melodie   and so on...
22:44 melodie   the line of the middle with Alt-gr+right-shift:
22:44 melodie   Ä„Ë‚¥ÐÜÏĿÖÙ
22:44 melodie   ÆÂ¢ÊÞŸÛÎŒÔ
22:44 melodie   this was the upper line
22:45 melodie   ±≠
22:46 melodie   I didn't try with a US keyboard setup to US :)
22:46 melodie   I have a US keyboard on a laptop but I always set it up to fr
22:51 pdurbin_m melodie: you scared him away ;)
22:52 melodie   impossible
22:52 pdurbin_m heh
22:53 melodie   even when I try to scare someone I just make them laugh...
22:53 melodie   :p
23:03 slystone  Hi!
23:04 slystone  melodie, pdurbin: !ping
23:05 melodie   hi slystone
23:06 melodie   everyone here will be asked to leave at some time, in order for pdurbin to regain the control of the chan : TechDesk is stucked here until tomorrow evening because he is logged from home, but not at home
23:06 melodie   slystone apart from that anything new?
23:08 slystone  melodie: well, not much. What you said I already knew, I was just wondering what was going on since some staff was in here.
23:08 slystone  melodie: how are you?
23:08 melodie   fine thanks, and you ?
23:08 pdurbin_m melodie: or they can make one of us an op. then we can register the channel
23:08 melodie   may we have a short talk privately?
23:09 slystone  Fine! I'm just back from rollerblading, it's getting pretty cold.
