00:01 pdurbin melodie: I made an interesting discovery the other day... on topic for this channel
00:26 melodie hi pdurbin
00:26 melodie what is it?
00:28 pdurbin melodie: Online Education: IRC channels - https://sites.google.com/site/onlineeduirc/
00:28 pdurbin "This site is managed by channel operators of #free-class (irc.freenode.net)"
00:29 pdurbin https://sites.google.com/site/onlineeduirc/coursera
00:29 pdurbin https://sites.google.com/site/onlineeduirc/udacity
00:30 melodie add the link to the above topic?
00:31 melodie pdurbin cs50 is not in the list yet
00:34 pdurbin adding a link to the topic would be a good start
00:34 pdurbin but I wonder... should we all simply join #free-class?
00:35 pdurbin and if we like #free-class... should we consider shutting down #wonderstudy?
00:38 melodie what does #free-class look like? And if you shut #wonderstudy what will you do with the wonderstudy github page?
00:39 melodie pdurbin in the coming days, would you ask the question to the other member of the present channel?
00:41 pdurbin melodie: like this channel, #free-class seems to be pretty quiet
00:41 melodie yes
00:41 pdurbin martinux_qc sebbu ubitux lupo49_ realz: what do you think of all this?
00:42 realz   lol high
00:42 pdurbin melodie: I think http://wonderstudy.github.io is a good resource, but we could probably copy the content somewhere else
00:43 pdurbin realz: lol? :)
00:43 realz   er
00:43 realz   sorry, I often mispell things phonetically
00:43 realz   hi :D
00:44 realz   pdurbin: I have a rather large list of cs-related channels on freenode
00:44 realz   if you interested
00:44 realz   it had #free-class on it
00:44 pdurbin realz: yeah, so do I: http://wiki.greptilian.com/haunts
00:45 realz   mmm cool I'll take those
00:45 pdurbin heh
01:15 pdurbin anyway, I think everyone here should consider joining #free-class to see if they like it
01:20 melodie pdurbin or we could switch wonderstudy to a "all languages chan" ?
01:20 melodie ^^
01:21 pdurbin but I only speak American ;)
01:21 pdurbin and Spanglish, I guess :)
01:23 melodie I don't speak code, but I still read some to try to understand what it says, and I even succeed doing so now sometimes
01:23 melodie :p
01:24 pdurbin I did ok the other week in #linuxvillage with my terrible Spanish (I think)
01:24 pdurbin :)
01:25 melodie nice, was there a spanish person there?
01:25 melodie I don't read the logs everyday...
01:32 pdurbin melodie: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2013-10-14#i_7713363
01:36 melodie ok, seen thanks
01:38 pdurbin melodie: no one is talking to us in #free-class: http://www.elitter.net/~amberj/irclogs/free-class/year-13/month-11/%23free-class-day14.txt
01:51 pdurbin our IRC logs are better ;)
01:53 melodie pdurbin they don't talk at all you mean
01:55 pdurbin oh! I have something to talk about. one sec
01:55 pdurbin "What's the word for homeschooling when it's for higher education?" -- https://twitter.com/anildash/status/399379275738251264
01:56 pdurbin I thought this was an interesting answer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_University
02:21 melodie thanks
02:21 melodie it's supra late now, so heading to bed
06:20 ubitux  mmh? what's the question?
