12:51 melodie   hi
12:51 melodie   I don't know if I like the name
12:51 pdurbin   what?!? ;)
12:52 melodie   wonder as in wonderland or wonder as "I am in a wonder"
12:52 pdurbin   what's not to like about #wonderstudy? ;)
12:52 melodie   no ?
12:52 pdurbin   wonder as in... "I'm wondering about something... I want to learn more about something"
12:52 melodie   "what's not to like" I can't understand this sentence
12:54 pdurbin   wonderstudy is a play on words, it sounds like understudy
12:56 pdurbin   an understudy is an actor or actress who learns all the lines for a part and is ready to perform if someone gets sick and can not perform
12:57 melodie   this might not be understood by the majority of people. : in the world million people speak English, and among them several million are not English native
12:57 pdurbin   sure, I understand that
12:57 melodie   if it were dedicated to English natives only it would sound nice and fun, and otherwise not at hand
12:58 pdurbin   you don't like the word "wonder"?
12:58 pdurbin   a child is full of wonder, very curious about the world
12:59 melodie   it is the first time I hear about understudy, and I have been learning english since school and came to practice a lot along the years, although not everyday, except on forums these last years, and on chans
12:59 melodie   I'd choose something more direct such as #onlinestudies
12:59 pdurbin   sure. understudy is not a common word. you hear it if you are an actor or if you go to a lot of plays
12:59 melodie   or #onlineuniversities
13:00 melodie   who will it be dedicated to in your idea ?
13:00 melodie   the users or the ones who make the courses ?
13:00 pdurbin   the users
13:01 melodie   will it be dedicated to computing or to any topic ?
13:01 pdurbin   any topic
13:01 melodie   how will you bring people to it, from the online courses ?
13:02 pdurbin   by linking to the IRC logs
13:02 pdurbin   or people might search and find the IRC logs
13:02 melodie   pdurbin I stick to what I said before : #opencourseware, because you can link to the wikipedia definition in the topic of the chan
13:02 melodie   it's more precise, it is known
13:04 melodie   anywhere we talk about it, forums, mails, mailing lists, we can link to the wikipedia definition and announce we created a chan for discussions around the topics
13:04 melodie   but do as you wish..
13:04 pdurbin   I understand but people might think that a channel named #opencourseware is officially part of The OpenCourseWare Consortium ( http://www.ocwconsortium.org ) ... but any channel I start wouldn't be
13:04 melodie   then name it ##opencourseware
13:04 melodie   this will sound not so official
13:05 pdurbin   heh. that *is* the freenode convention
13:05 melodie   if they don't know the diff
13:05 melodie   yes, you can tell them it is a freenode convention to show it's not official
13:05 melodie   conventions are meant to be used
13:06 pdurbin   I'm still more comfortable with having a unique name
13:06 melodie   what is a unique name ?
13:07 pdurbin   a name that does not imply it is part of a different organization
13:07 melodie   ok then what about #opencourses ?
13:08 melodie   :)
13:08 melodie   pdurbin is thinking... ;-)
13:08 pdurbin   hmm, maybe but when I wonder about something I often listen to podcasts about a topic rather than listening to or watching a full course
13:09 pdurbin   in this way "wonderstudy" is more broad. it can refer to other forms of study besides courses
13:09 melodie   humm
13:09 pdurbin   you wonder about something, then you study it :)
13:09 melodie   when I wonder about something, anything, I go to the chans I know and ask there
13:10 pdurbin   sure, that could be on topic too :)
13:10 melodie   if opening a chan dedicated to the people studying online with edx and other places mean having the same sort of direction then of what use would it be ?
13:11 pdurbin   why have more than one channel, you are asking?
13:11 melodie   if you open a chan dedicated to the people who don't have one yet, and make it have a name that is self-explanatory...
13:12 melodie   then the people who want to help and get help for their studies throught the open course ware places will know it is the very chan for them
13:13 melodie   they can be from any country: India, China, US, Uruguay, Spain, Germany, France, Quebec, Kenya : they will not wonder about this IRC wonderland ;-)
13:13 pdurbin   heh
13:13 pdurbin   well, at least it has the word "study" in it :)
13:13 pdurbin   that helps, right?
13:13 pdurbin   :)
13:13 melodie   not really
13:13 pdurbin   !
13:14 pdurbin   I think it helps :)
13:15 melodie   it might be a matter of semantics
13:15 pdurbin   it definitely is :)
13:15 melodie   what you think might not reflect what we see
13:15 melodie   let me demonstrate to you
13:15 melodie   https://www.edx.org/
13:15 melodie   do ctrl+f and type in study
13:15 melodie   then
13:15 melodie   do ctrl+f and type in course : what do you see ?
13:17 pdurbin   nothing for "study" and a lot for "course" ... and it's the same at http://coursera.org of course... heh of "course" :)
13:18 pdurbin   "naming a website is hard. Really, really hard" -- http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/04/help-name-our-website.html :)
13:18 pdurbin   the same is true of IRC channels :)
13:19 pdurbin   of course, I'll probably want a website for this too
13:19 pdurbin   whatever the final name is :)
13:21 pdurbin   melodie: again, at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2013-05-11#i_7050091 I told you I had thought of a "working title" ... which is #wonderstudy ... I'm ok with changing it if we can think of something better :)
13:21 melodie   pdurbin and this in my idea would be related to what people's minds have registered: when they register "courses" many times, the word "study" might refer more to their own hard work, than to what is provided to them... or this kind of thing
13:21 pdurbin   hmm, you think the word "study" sounds somewhat negative? sounds like work? something difficult?
13:24 pdurbin   while the word "course" refers to something they are happy and excited about, something they're getting for free in many cases :)
13:24 melodie   I am not a specialist of semantics and of psychology, but I would say using a word which is commonly used in the websites dedicated to the courses would be better.
13:25 melodie   it has chances to sound more attractive to people
13:25 melodie   let me tell you about the recent creation of Linuxvillage
13:25 melodie   with the two other persons we have discussed about the name by mail during several days :D
13:26 pdurbin   I like the name linuxvillage
13:26 melodie   I had a fun thought about farmville and suggested "linuxville" and we also where looking for something which could sound good as well in English as in French and we had many ideas of names, until turzin came out with linuxvillage : and we decided it was the ideal one
13:27 melodie   the name is the key for a successful start.
13:30 pdurbin   a good name is great but I think what's more important is to get people excited about the idea behind the name. and the idea can spread. as you have spread the idea of linuxvillage
13:30 pdurbin   it sounds like you would prefer something like #onlinecourses
13:31 pdurbin   but I'm not very excited about that because at the moment I'm not taking any online courses
13:32 melodie   would you create a chan for yourself or for others ? :D
13:32 pdurbin   heh
13:32 pdurbin   well, I don't think I'm the only one doing this :)
13:32 melodie   I have an idea
13:32 melodie   create two chans
13:32 pdurbin   to me "courses" is a bit too narrow
13:33 melodie   one for you and one for others
13:33 pdurbin   heh
13:33 melodie   why is it narrow ?
13:33 melodie   you could have : #opencourses
13:33 melodie   and
13:33 melodie   have #opencourses-off-topic
13:33 melodie   for tchit tchat
13:36 pdurbin   "courses" is too narrow for me because I'm learning a lot non-course material, such as talks from conferences such as JavaOne. if you look at "review" under http://wiki.greptilian.com/java/javaone/2012 you can see which talks I have listened to and what I thought about it
13:36 pdurbin   these talks are not courses. they're each a single lecture
13:36 melodie   ok then I have a third idea
13:36 melodie   this could be #openlearning
13:37 melodie   do you like it ?
13:37 pdurbin   I like #openlearning better than #opencourses
13:37 melodie   ok
13:38 melodie   will you check if it is available ?
13:39 pdurbin   meh. I still like #wonderstudy a little better :)
13:40 pdurbin   melodie: whatever the name is, you want the IRC channel to be logged?
13:42 melodie   yes, that can be convenient
13:42 melodie   pdurbin why don't you ask their opinions to other people too ? or create the two chans ?
13:43 pdurbin   well, I already dropped a link in #crimsonfu: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2013-05-11#i_7050195
13:43 pdurbin   maybe someone from there will join us :)
13:44 pdurbin   melodie: you are welcome to invite people to join us here as well :)
13:44 melodie   oh oh !
13:44 pdurbin   I love a good debate :)
13:44 melodie   ok
13:45 melodie   I am not sure they are going to be interested but I will right on
13:45 pdurbin   if we can't even get people interested in joining in a discussion over what to call our IRC channel, I'm worried we won't ever find people who want to be in the IRC channel :)
13:47 melodie   done, on three chans
13:47 melodie   I am not
13:47 melodie   I am sure I can bring people to a chan having for name #openlearning :)
13:48 melodie   I am convinced 100% !
13:48 pdurbin   heh
13:49 pdurbin   I just dropped a link here: http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-11#t1368280123
13:49 pdurbin   melodie: ah, I see you dropped a link here: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2013-05-11#i_7050240
13:50 pdurbin   melodie: do the other 2 channels have logs? the channels where you asked?
13:50 OpTimus   hi all
13:51 melodie   no they don't ##programation and #cyber-nux are French chans
13:51 pdurbin   OpTimus: oh hi!
13:51 melodie   salut OpTimus !
13:51 melodie   pdurbin OpTimus is from #cyber-nux
13:51 pdurbin   never heard of it but I'm sure it's awesome :)
13:51 OpTimus   i'm glad to meet you pdurbin
13:51 pdurbin   ditto
13:52 melodie   OpTimus I try to convince pdurbin to use #openlearning as a name for a chan dedicated to learning, and he prefers #wonderstudy - this is a detail, but which name talks more to you ?
13:52 pdurbin   OpTimus: if you are willing... it would be helpful if you read through the conversation so far: http://irclog.greptilian.com/wonderstudy/2013-05-11#i_6059
13:53 OpTimus   i'm already on it
13:53 pdurbin   perfect
13:53 OpTimus   the debate is very interesting
13:54 pdurbin   melodie: when I said "what's not to like about #wonderstudy" it is like saying, "how is it possible that you do not like #wonderstudy?!?" :)
13:55 melodie   pdurbin what I think is not about what I like but about what is self explanatory and likely to attract lots of people to talk together and help each other : create a very dynamic community !
13:56 pdurbin   melodie: that's the biggest thing you and I have in common I think... we both like building communities :)
13:56 melodie   :D
13:59 melodie   pdurbin my companion likes the name of your chan : his vote in your favor
14:00 melodie   he thinks the name is very nice, and I have also explained him about understudy, he agrees it's not obvious but find the name of the chan cute
14:00 pdurbin   \o/
14:01 pdurbin   I'm ok with cute
14:01 pdurbin   I asked the people on Google+ about the name: https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/eNwHbFEyDpj
14:01 melodie   salut Goodbox !
14:01 pdurbin   Goodbox: welcome!
14:01 Goodbox   Hi :) I come from #cyber-nux, just observing, o/ melodie  :)
14:01 Goodbox   Thanks !
14:01 pdurbin   jinx
14:02 melodie   pdurbin can you explain them who you are and how you grabbed me at the #ubuntu-women chan one day to bring me to #crimsonfu ?
14:03 pdurbin   melodie: better yet, they can read for themselves! http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/03/19/%23ubuntu-women-project.html :)
14:04 melodie   Goodbox OpTimus pdurbin has given me information about http://edx.org and http://cs50.tv/fall - and has this page: http://people.iq.harvard.edu/~pdurbin
14:04 pdurbin   I was just thinking, I should explain that I curate audio content at http://huffduffer.com/philipdurbin and http://huffduffer.com/pdurbin and https://soundcloud.com/philipdurbin
14:04 melodie   and at some time I suggested to open a chan dedicated to all the courses provided on Internet, from universities and elsewhere
14:04 Goodbox   Well i'm checking that
14:05 melodie   pdurbin what does "curate" mean ?
14:05 melodie   tu vois OpTimus des fois je demande aussi quand je ne sais pas
14:07 Goodbox   melodie: there's undernet irc networke which purpose some courses in live
14:07 Goodbox   Have you tried ?
14:07 melodie   I don't know about it
14:07 melodie   which server is that ?
14:08 Goodbox   I heard about that, but i never took a visit
14:08 Goodbox   http://www.undernet.org/servers/
14:08 melodie   Goodbox and this chan would not be about getting courses but rather helping each other and discuss about courses which already exist, such as cs50
14:08 melodie   or cs164 and others
14:09 melodie   these courses have mailing lists, but no live chan
14:09 OpTimus   what is cs164
14:10 melodie   a course at http://edx.org : you can check all available courses there
14:10 Goodbox   cs50.tv is timing out
14:10 melodie   is it ?
14:10 melodie   http://cs50.tv/2011/fall/
14:10 melodie   this is the right url
14:11 Goodbox   thank's
14:11 OpTimus   i think that live courses is good for some persons who don't have time in journey or night
14:12 Goodbox   Then we're talking about educatives ability and accesseibility for everyone ?
14:12 OpTimus   yes
14:13 OpTimus   but it still rest a serious problem in many countries undevelopped
14:14 pdurbin   I need to take my daughter to ballet soon. people shouldn't feel required to announce when they are going to be away from keyboard though :) ... I will catch up later by reading the IRC log
14:16 Goodbox   Good afternoon :)
14:17 OpTimus   Good afternoon
14:17 OpTimus   and have fun with fun with your daughter
14:18 melodie   ok pdurbin see you soon and have a nice time
14:18 melodie   OpTimus journay is voyage, you may have meant "day" ?
14:19 slystone  yop
14:19 melodie   salut slystone !
14:19 slystone  Chalut melodie :)
14:20 slystone  Je viens de rentrer en Normandie, et je rentre demain à Paname. :)
14:20 melodie   eh les gars on peut parler en français maintenant ! (ou pas ? 0_0 : le chan est loggué)
14:20 slystone  Je récupère bientôt mon temps et la fibre ! \o/
14:20 OpTimus   okay
14:20 slystone  melodie: whatever works!
14:20 slystone  o/ OpTimus
14:21 slystone  Prime?
14:21 melodie   slystone tu peux rattraper la discussion de ici en lisant cette page: http://irclog.greptilian.com/wonderstudy/2013-05-11
14:21 OpTimus   en chair et en binaire
14:21 melodie   je dois y aller aussi
14:21 melodie   à bientôt
14:21 OpTimus   melodie, je vois que le lien sur le cs5O est tres interessant
14:21 melodie   OpTimus j'ai commencé, et aussi modifié l'application cs50
14:22 melodie   je te montre vite fait ce que je propose:
14:22 melodie   https://github.com/cs50/appliance50/issues
14:22 melodie   j'ai fait deux versions modifiées et mises en ligne, en fr et en en mais je préfèrerais pouvoir installer leurs applications d'apprentissage sur une ubuntu mini openbox et en faire une iso...
14:23 melodie   leur application est une machine virtuelle pouvant aller sous vmware ou virtualbox au choix, donc ça marche sur toutes plateformes, sauf que dans ma machine ça laguait grave alors j'ai ajouté zram avec une install spéciale
14:23 OpTimus   ha je vois
14:23 slystone  melodie: ok merci
14:24 OpTimus   c'est vraiment cool
14:24 melodie   plaisir ! c'est un super cours !
14:24 OpTimus   je vais bien m'occuper
14:24 OpTimus   en fait je voudrais te demander
14:24 melodie   quoi ?
14:24 OpTimus   selon le tuto de coyotus
14:25 OpTimus   ou il fallait installer MingW
14:25 Goodbox   hi slystone :)
14:25 OpTimus   je sais pas trop comment lancer cette appli une fois que je l'ai installlé
14:25 melodie   no idea
14:25 melodie   what is MingW anyhow ?
14:26 Goodbox   Mingw is an gnu layer implemetation of gcc for window
14:26 OpTimus   but i don't what really he can do
14:26 melodie   OpTimus wouldn't asking at #cyber-nux more relevant ?
14:27 melodie   http://www.mingw.org/
14:27 melodie   "MinGW provides a complete Open Source programming tool set which is suitable for the development of native MS-Windows applications, and which do not depend on any 3rd-party C-Runtime DLLs. ... "
14:27 melodie   and voila!
14:27 melodie   ;D
14:28 pdurbin   oh good. English again :)
14:28 Goodbox   OpTimus: mingw can be a part of a M$ survival kit :p
14:30 slystone  yop Goodbox
14:30 slystone  Goodbox: est-ce que t'habites Paname par hasard ?
14:30 OpTimus   je vois
14:31 Goodbox   slystone: nan, alsace :p
14:31 slystone  Goodbox: ok tant pis.
14:32 Goodbox   slystone: :/
14:32 Goodbox   j'aurais pu t'aider pour quelque chose ?
14:32 melodie   pdurbin if you take a beginner course to learn French we can help you !
14:32 Goodbox   Sachez que ma porte est grande ouverte aux utilisateurs de LL :)
14:32 slystone  Goodbox: on cherche des modems 56k afin de les envoyer en Syrie, et d'aider les habitants à rester connectés au monde.
14:33 Goodbox   slystone: Oh, ça c'est une belle mission !
14:33 slystone  Goodbox: yep ! C'est jujusete qui m'a demandé en fait. Elle en a besoin pour demain soir ou lundi midi, je ne sais plus.
14:34 Goodbox   D'acc, je vais voir, j'ai un vieux modem 8noeuds, je crois qu'il ne fonctionne plus, sinon j'ai des modems adsl de 2004/5
14:34 Goodbox   si ça peut servir
14:35 slystone  Goodbox: hum, si ça marche pour le 56k, c'est tout bon. Demande à jujusete. Tu ne vas pas pouvoir les envoyer sur Paname à temps je pense.
14:36 Goodbox   yep :/
14:37 Goodbox   Je pense qu'il à également prévu une infrastructure pour leur faire parvenir un internet potable ? proxy et tunnel ?
14:42 pdurbin   melodie: well, we should decide early if this channel will be English-preferred (which I would like) or not
14:43 OpTimus   des modems de 56k?
14:43 OpTimus   il y'a des clé internet 3g qui font le travail 2 fois plus
14:44 OpTimus   et puis cela aide a rester toujours ouvert meme quand on est dans un bunker :)
14:44 pdurbin   melodie: because honestly this channel quickly becomes uninteresting to me if I can't understand what is being said because I can't read the language :(
14:44 Goodbox   OpTimus: je sais pas si il y a la 3G là bas OpTimus x)
14:45 pdurbin   I'm not trying to be rude... I'm trying to be honest :)
14:45 Goodbox   pdurbin: Sure, this is an english chan
14:47 Goodbox   pdurbin: sorry, slystone was talking to me about sending 56k modems in Syria, to keep humans connecteds
14:48 Goodbox   It would be wonderful, as you said slystone , if jujesete win his post of modems
14:48 slystone  pdurbin: sorry for that, I'll try to speak English.
14:49 slystone  pdurbin: once I asked melodie if it would not be better if there were two chanels, one in English and one in French.
14:49 slystone  She told me it worked, and that it was no problem. So I thought we could use both languages.
14:49 slystone  No offence taken. ;)
14:50 slystone  And sometimes I'm just too lazy to type in English, even if I'm fully bilingual.
14:50 Goodbox   slystone: Haha, you "tryed" :p, that's my case ! not your !
14:51 slystone  Goodbox: gnagnagna :p
14:51 Goodbox   Hi Darkos80
14:51 slystone  o/ Darkos80
14:51 melodie   pdurbin I wanted to provide fast information to OpTimus about the courses because he told me his is not fluent enough in English, so I told him and Goodbox about the cs50 especially and about the work I have done on the appliance when I started
14:51 melodie   nothing more
14:52 slystone  pdurbin: also, I think that a bilingual chan is interesting (what is #linuxvillage) because we can both learn from each other.
14:52 melodie   hi Darkos80 !
14:53 melodie   slystone pdurbin does not talk french at all, and here will be an international channel so we'd better talk English here in fact
14:53 slystone  But I'll obide to whatever rule is set for this chan of course. :)
14:53 slystone  melodie: roger! I'll type in English then.
14:53 melodie   pdurbin sorry I gave the bad example. My fault!
14:53 pdurbin   thank you very much :)
14:53 slystone  ^^
14:54 pdurbin   we should try to use plain English though, so non-native speakers can better understand
14:55 slystone  pdurbin: haha, that will be tricky!
14:55 Goodbox   I purpose we ask in french specific terms if we don't know, i'm sure melodie and slystone will return the answer with pleasure !
14:57 slystone  Goodbox: well, you can count on me. ;) I don't have always the answer (especially for technical terms), but I studied English literature and civilizatons at University, so I should be able to help. :)
14:58 Goodbox   Nice, it will permit to improve my expression ! :)
14:58 slystone  :)
14:58 slystone  Goodbox: you know ##English I suppose?
14:59 Goodbox   Oh no, I missed this chan
15:02 pdurbin   melodie: when I said I like to curate audio content I mean that I listen to a lot of audio content and try to link the the best stuff, the stuff I think people will like
15:02 pdurbin   people are encouraged to drop links to interesting audio content in here :)
15:03 pdurbin   video content too. recently I figured out how to quickly convert mp4 to mp3 (or ogg) on my server and add the audio to a podcast feed to get it onto my phone to listen to
15:04 pdurbin   conversion is just `ffmpeg -i video.mp4 audio.mp3` ... then I run the script from https://github.com/inoks/dropcast to make it into a feed
15:05 Goodbox   Distributing content in free formats is a great thing
15:10 pdurbin   Goodbox: yes. have you seen #oggcastplanet on freenode or http://oggcastplanet.blogspot.com/ ?  I saw the channel at http://hackerpublicradio.org
15:12 pdurbin   oh, you can see what I mean in the "feeds" folder at http://tmp.greptilian.com but I'm not sure how stable that URL will be. it might go away. I'll probably find a more permanent home for this idea in the future
15:14 Goodbox   okay, the rss feed is working fine !
15:16 pdurbin   cool. mostly I use that rss feed in BeyondPod on my android phone
15:16 pdurbin   but it should work on any podcatcher. I would hope
15:17 Goodbox   It seems be good for all rss reader
15:17 pdurbin   I find that in many cases I don't need to watch a video lecture. it's enough to listen to the audio, which I can do while I'm washing dishes, folding laundry, etc.
17:48 pdurbin   znk: welcome!
18:23 pdurbin   slystone: my logging bot (philbot) disconnected for a while so the last few lines didn't get logged :(
18:23 pdurbin   you were talking about Shaarli
18:24 pdurbin   "Shaarli is a minimalist delicious clone you can install on your own website" -- http://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php:shaarli
18:25 pdurbin   and I was saying it reminds me a bit of http://devlog.spilth.org/about/ which is "inspired by http://sourcefu.com "
18:25 pdurbin   and how I started #sourcefu ... which is a place to talk about programming
18:26 slystone  Well, I was saying that the presentation is pretty… short.
18:27 pdurbin   slystone: for devlog? yeah
18:28 pdurbin   I like it when people try out new ideas though, when they experiment
18:28 pdurbin   #wonderstudy is only a few hours old... just an experiment for now :)
18:29 pdurbin   but who knows, if we like the name (still up for debate) we can register a domain and set up a website
18:29 slystone  Me too. I just expect a few details when someone is presenting a project, especially since there are so many possibilities.
18:30 pdurbin   yeah
18:30 pdurbin   melodie: you're back! maybe because you saw me update this: Learning new things online with universities - http://beta.linuxvillage.net/index.php/topic,298.0.html ;)
18:30 pdurbin   I couldn't resist linking to the first day of #wonderstudy logs :)
18:31 slystone  melodie: you never stay connected on IRC? You should use a bouncer or your server.
18:31 pdurbin   I was just saying the name is still up for debate :)
19:01 Goodbox   Personally i'm just running irssi inside a screen session, that's fine :D
19:01 melodie   ok
19:02 melodie   welcome back to all !
19:02 Goodbox   Re melodie !
19:02 melodie   he Goodbox
19:02 Goodbox   I dunno how we say the french "Re"
19:02 Goodbox   x)
19:04 Goodbox   Hi TechDesk !
19:04 TechDesk  lut
19:04 melodie   hello TechDesk welcome here !
19:14 pdurbin   TechDesk: welcome!
19:14 pdurbin   Goodbox: me too but weechat instead of irssi
19:15 Goodbox   :3
19:17 Goodbox   There is often splits on freenode these lasts hours
19:17 Goodbox   unusual
19:20 pdurbin   quite unusual
19:21 pdurbin   I think that's why my logging bot (philbot) dropped out earlier. usually it reconnects automatically though
19:23 pdurbin   melodie: are you tired of debating the name? ;)
19:27 pdurbin   does anyone like a name other than "wonderstudy" better?
19:28 Goodbox   I find this name is well appropriated :)
19:28 pdurbin   appropriated? you think the name is ok?
19:29 Goodbox   Owh yes, appropriate
19:30 Goodbox   Damn it I learned english at school...
19:30 pdurbin   I only speak one language :(
19:30 pdurbin   well, a little bit of Spanish
19:31 pdurbin   and my three year old is teaching me some Chinese
19:31 melodie   pdurbin what would you wish ? Do you wish more ideas for names or do you stick to this idea fermly as a mold on it's rock ? :)
19:31 pdurbin   dà for "big"
19:31 Goodbox   Speaking one lanugage seems good enough ! :)
19:32 pdurbin   heh
19:32 pdurbin   wonderstudy is only a few hours old but already it is moldy ;)
19:33 Goodbox   did you find it moldy :o
19:33 pdurbin   melodie: I don't know what I wish for. I'm ok with changing the name if someone can think of a fun and awesome name
19:33 Goodbox   Maybe interpretation of this name differs by native languages of people reading it
19:34 Goodbox   Generally for french people, english consonance sound pretty well
19:34 TechDesk  y'est-ce
19:34 pdurbin   "I think the problem that you're running into is "native English speakers will consider the name catchy and clever" vs "non-native English speakers (or even differently-educated English speakers) won't know what you're talking about."  Clever+ unambiguous are hard streams to cross.﻿" -- Amy Rich at https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/eNwHbFEyDpj
19:35 melodie   Goodbox
19:35 melodie   Goodbox &lt;pdurbin&gt; wonderstudy is a play on words, it sounds like understudy
19:35 melodie   &lt;pdurbin&gt; an understudy is an actor or actress who learns all the lines for a part and is ready to perform if someone gets sick and can not perform
19:35 pdurbin   I'm actually pretty happy Amy thinks it's clever :)
19:35 pdurbin   catchy even!
19:36 melodie   pdurbin all seem to like the name for now so let's just grab lots of people who want to help each other for studies and throw them here ? ;-)
19:36 Goodbox   Yes, i'm agree
19:37 pdurbin   ok!
19:37 pdurbin   should we have a website?
19:37 TechDesk  y'est-ce aïe âme à grès
19:37 Goodbox   It might be intersting for presenting ideas and contents
19:37 melodie   pdurbin no, what for ?
19:38 melodie   Goodbox the websites are already out there... pdurbin edx and so on ?
19:38 pdurbin   well, we can wait
19:38 melodie   unless you want a page to gather them all ?
19:38 melodie   such as:
19:38 pdurbin   I think we might want one eventually. let's think about it
19:38 melodie   http://wonderstudy.wordpress.com ? :D
19:39 pdurbin   no no, we can buy a domain
19:39 melodie   yes, that does not cost much
19:39 melodie   about 6 euros TVA included here
19:39 pdurbin   and we can host it for free on GitHub Pages: http://pages.github.com
19:39 pdurbin   melodie: do you want to buy it? :)
19:40 melodie   no I don't
19:40 pdurbin   ok, no worries :)
19:44 melodie   in fact I'd like to sell stuff, not buy :D
19:54 pdurbin   ok, we have a website now: http://wonderstudy.github.io
19:55 pdurbin   the source of it is here: https://github.com/wonderstudy/wonderstudy.github.io
19:55 pdurbin   pull requests welcome :)
19:56 pdurbin   melodie: I made you an owner: https://github.com/wonderstudy?tab=members
19:56 melodie   why ?
19:57 pdurbin   in case I get hit by a bus
19:57 melodie   :o
19:57 melodie   don't, you have children and they need you
19:57 pdurbin   it could happen. crazy drivers in Boston. and I bike a lot
19:59 pdurbin   I'll be careful. but I *did* get hit hard enough a few months ago (while I was stopped at a red light!) that my back wheel was bent and need to be replaced: https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/99xPso8Tkka
19:59 slystone  pdurbin: it's a good thing your three year old is learning Chinese. If you learn a foreign language before the age of seven, it's better.
20:00 pdurbin   slystone: yes. and my six year old is learning Spanish in school. it's great
20:00 slystone  :)
20:00 melodie   oh, that's bad!
20:00 pdurbin   my three year old is really into Chinese. it's so cute :)
20:00 melodie   terrible drivers
20:01 melodie   the schools are pretty good at your place. is that public schools or private ?
20:01 slystone  pdurbin | it could happen. crazy drivers in Boston. and I bike a lot ← tell me about it. :( Same in Paris. I ended up on a car hood a month ago.
20:01 pdurbin   slystone: !
20:01 slystone  (while rollerblading)
20:02 pdurbin   melodie: public schools. they're very good
20:02 melodie   how lucky !
20:02 pdurbin   well, we picked a town with good schools :)
20:02 melodie   slystone we would like to have such good schools for the kids in France, wouldn't we ?
20:03 slystone  pdurbin: awwwwwwwww! I'm a little jealous. And indeed, it must be pretty sweet to see your kid learning Chinese. ^^
20:03 melodie   pdurbin oh, I see. Anyhow I think we don't find this in France in public schools
20:03 pdurbin   slystone: I need to get a video of her singing the Chinese color song
20:03 slystone  melodie: well yes! But right now, there is no plan to begin teaching a foreign language in pre-school.
20:04 melodie   pdurbin when you get it I'll be interested too
20:04 slystone  (which is very unfortunate)
20:04 melodie   slystone in France there are too many hours of class and not enough for life
20:05 melodie   pdurbin my son was in 10th grade last year (we say 6th in France) and the number of hours per week was around 40/41
20:05 melodie   it does not end there, there are still some homework after. :s
20:06 Goodbox   For my part, I leave school when I was 17 years old, there was no way to work and demotivated teachers...
20:06 slystone  http://www.babylangues.com/english/why-start-so-young.php ← I've applied to work here. They asked me for a second letter, wait and see…
20:07 pdurbin   slystone: nice
20:07 melodie   slystone good!
20:08 slystone  melodie: I don't know if there are too many hours. The main problem to me is after elementary school. You have a same school for everybody, which is insane, because some want to drop school simply, some are very advanced and are bored to death, and some already know what they want to achieved, and are frustrated.
20:08 melodie   slystone I have met a girl in a US school where I have been during one year. She used to speak fluently 4 languages as she had been living since she was born in contact with people of the 4 different languages
20:09 slystone  melodie: yep, it makes it so easy.
20:09 melodie   she could speak either or and think in each of them currently
20:10 slystone  At an English conversation table I had organized, I met someone who can speak ten languages. He was lucky enough to have a mother from Poland (who spoke Yiddish, German, and Polish), and to have a father from Portugal (who spoke Spanish too), and who had met in France.
20:10 slystone  Lucky bastard!
20:14 NoNa      ah coucou
20:14 pdurbin   NoNa: welcome!
20:14 melodie   hello NoNa !
20:14 NoNa      huhu merci :)
20:14 melodie   I forgot to tell you we must all talk in English here because it's international
20:14 pdurbin   thank goodness :)
20:14 melodie   and the main owner of the chan does not speak French either ^^
20:14 Goodbox   hi NoNa :)
20:14 NoNa      hi Goodbox
20:15 * NoNa    speak english very bad
20:16 melodie   NoNa you may learn by practice, and this will also be very good for your computing studies
20:16 melodie   did you know pdurbin is a famous coder ?
20:17 NoNa      no I did'nt know
20:17 NoNa      don(t
20:17 NoNa      don't
20:17 NoNa      arf
20:17 slystone  o/ NoNa
20:18 NoNa      o/ slystone
20:18 slystone  :)
20:18 pdurbin   ha!
20:18 NoNa      I go to work my english here
20:18 pdurbin   I'm a hack
20:19 melodie   NoNa this is what pdurbin does: http://people.iq.harvard.edu/~pdurbin
20:19 pdurbin   I do think I'm getting better... practice, practice :)
20:19 melodie   pdurbin NoNa is a student in computer sciences in Toulouse, the pink city
20:20 pdurbin   NoNa: which languages have you studied so far?
20:21 NoNa      well, I do c++, javascript, sql, and html css
20:21 pdurbin   ah. very nice!
20:22 slystone  melodie: you should explain the meaning of “ the Pink City ”. :p
20:22 pdurbin   NoNa: you can improve out website: http://wonderstudy.github.io ... it's quite simple... it could be much better :)
20:22 pdurbin   our*
20:22 slystone  pdurbin: do you know MySecureShell?
20:23 pdurbin   slystone: no...
20:23 slystone  ok, nevermind!
20:24 pdurbin   my kids would love a pink city. they're so girly
20:25 slystone  pdurbin: http://www.meditatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Toulouse-Ville.jpg
20:25 pdurbin   look what they did to my chair: https://plus.google.com/109940583958656614840/posts/Sd5EXf8utcA !
20:26 pdurbin   slystone: pretty!
20:27 slystone  pdurbin: kr kr kr! I bet you're so happy to seat in this chair! ^^
20:27 pdurbin   grrr! ;)
20:27 Goodbox   they are cutes!
20:27 slystone  ^^
20:27 slystone  Goodbox: yes they are!
20:27 Goodbox   (cutes take a "s")
20:27 Goodbox   ?
20:27 slystone  Goodbox: no! :p
20:27 Goodbox   rho :/
20:28 slystone  :)
20:28 pdurbin   they are cute
20:28 pdurbin   they are cuties :)
20:31 pdurbin   so at http://wonderstudy.github.io I'll probably make a list of free courses I've listened to. and some I want to listen to some day. and some podcasts I listen to that might be of interest
20:33 pdurbin   maybe we should have "member" pages. so I can put all that stuff under a page called "pdurbin"
20:34 pdurbin   or we could have a common page for computer science. and a page for biology. or whatever
20:36 NoNa      sorry I've childrens pdurbin and they are so agitated
20:37 NoNa      and I 'm not here always
20:38 pdurbin   NoNa: believe me. I understand agitated children :) ... and I often step away from the keyboard for a long time. which is probably healthy :)
20:38 Goodbox   Anyone know a little open-source raytracer ?
20:38 NoNa      allright
20:39 pdurbin   Goodbox: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POV-Ray via http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly/24
20:40 Goodbox   I'm doing performances tests between glibc and musl static binaries, I guess raytracer might suit
20:40 pdurbin   POV-Ray - The Persistence of Vision Raytracer - http://www.povray.org
20:41 Goodbox   thank's pdurbin , I tought pov-ray, but he's coded in c++ :/ I missed to precice a C x)
20:42 Goodbox   however I can tune the musl-gcc wrapper to statically build povray anyway
20:45 pdurbin   musl-gcc?
20:46 Goodbox   this is a wrapper calling the musl standard C library instead of glibc
20:48 Goodbox   I found this little obfuscated raytracer winner of ioccc, however, it doesn't use math.h http://www.ioccc.org/2004/gavare.c :/
20:48 Goodbox   Argggh I hate obfuscated code
20:51 * pdurbin looks at http://www.musl-libc.org
21:17 slystone  'night! (I'm beat)
21:18 NoNa      good night
21:19 Goodbox   gn slystone :)
21:20 NoNa      me too
21:25 slystone  thanx :) (afk)
22:14 melodie   hello again
22:24 pdurbin   melodie: hi!
22:24 pdurbin   I just updated http://wonderstudy.github.io with some actual content
22:24 pdurbin   some recommendations, etc.
22:25 melodie   hi !
22:25 melodie   oh did you ?
22:26 pdurbin   what do you think?
22:27 melodie   pdurbin more here if you want to visit them and select a few more ? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opencourseware
22:27 melodie   unless you want to link directly to that page ?
22:27 melodie   I think you have been working a lot
22:27 melodie   very nice!
22:30 pdurbin   melodie: hmm, long page. maybe you mean these: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opencourseware#See_also
22:31 melodie   among else, yes. From this page I jumped on that one: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_Circle_Network
22:31 melodie   which is at the end of this part: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opencourseware#Americas
22:32 melodie   so if you restrict just to the "See_also" it might be short
22:32 melodie   perhaps visiting them little by little and adding them to the page you wrote would be an idea
22:45 melodie   pdurbin I notice this part in your page:
22:45 melodie   "The easiest way to join the conversation is via http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wonderstudy but desktop IRC clients include irssi, weechat, Pidgin, or Adium "
22:46 melodie   you don't mention xchat, and if you do you could also add a few forks from xchat which I can point to
22:46 melodie   such as hexchat:
22:46 melodie   5 community/hexchat 2.9.5-4
22:46 melodie   A popular and easy to use graphical IRC (chat) client
22:46 melodie   which is free open source, available as well for linux as for windows
22:47 pdurbin   melodie: because you are owner of the wonderstudy github organization you should be able to click Edit at https://github.com/wonderstudy/wonderstudy.github.io/blob/master/index.md and edit the page right from your browser. can you please give this a try?
22:48 pdurbin   (no pull request necessary)
22:48 melodie   I will but not tonight
22:48 melodie   I am starting to be sleepy and I just uploaded two images which I am staring at for the time being
22:48 melodie   I have to post about them
22:53 pdurbin   ok. no hurry
22:53 melodie   pdurbin I would not want to put risk in the edit move. :)
22:54 pdurbin   melodie: you could start by adding one word :)
22:54 melodie   no I won't
22:55 melodie   I will do that when mind fresh and some quiet around. :)
22:55 melodie   I will check the log of now from here and add a few things
22:55 melodie   accordingly
22:56 melodie   just incase I don't remember exactly what I wanted to add, of course
23:34 melodie   pdurbin ?
23:35 melodie   I am talking about #wonderstudy at #linuxchix on irc.linuxchix.org
23:36 pdurbin   ok
23:37 melodie   hi soulshake
23:38 soulshake o/
23:42 melodie   pdurbin is gone :(
23:42 melodie   but the chan is still logged so
23:42 melodie   &lt;aj&gt; melodie: your links remind me of another neat site: http://www.noexcuselist.com/
23:43 melodie   now it will be kept aside
