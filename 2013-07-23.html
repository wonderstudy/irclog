14:18 erikmaarten_ hello!
14:18 erikmaarten_ any interesting courses spotted lately?
14:22 pdurbin      erikmaarten_: no, but I recently noticed this... "Script for downloading Coursera.org videos" -- https://github.com/zmughal/coursera
14:46 erikmaarten_ pdurbin: nice, I've even been thinking about that. For one course I downloaded everything manually, but that is a bit tedious if you're doing it all at once ...
