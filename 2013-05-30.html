00:03 pdurbin  they do. it's true. but I think it would be great if they had more
00:04 melodie  would they have time left for the other things which fill their lives?
00:08 pdurbin  mostly they go to school+afterschool or day care. ballet and soccer on the weekends. swimming soon. they have time for more but it requires time from me or my wife (to bring them places, arrange activities, etc.)
00:09 melodie  pdurbin would you consider having some vacations with your family in France, South ? There are some lovely gites and chambres d'hôtes hold by English people around. :)
00:10 melodie  and lots of activities available for all ages
00:11 pdurbin  sounds great
00:12 pdurbin  oh. music too. I'd like them to take piano lessons
00:14 melodie  it is very possible around here, but just vacations for this might not be enough :D
00:15 melodie  pdurbin I give you a link in private, you can read
00:23 melodie  good night

17:47 melodie  hello pdurbin !
20:33 pdurbin  melodie: hi! busy day fixing bugs
20:33 pdurbin  and now to pick up the kids
20:34 melodie  pdurbin all right
20:34 melodie  I just read this page: http://www.cles.com/chronique/pourquoi-le-rechauffement-global-nous-glace-t-il-les-os // you would be interested to have a version in English.
20:34 melodie  maybe in translate.google.com it would be more or less ok
22:20 slystone melodie: well, I'd like to begin, but I still have no free time in sight. Maybe in two weeks ^^ (Salon Solutions Linux behind, Ubuntu Party ahead, then Foire à l'autogestion…)
22:28 melodie  slystone ? would you tell me more about this "Foire", but on #linuxvillage and in French please ?
