21:39 pdurbin melodie: should we get a domain for this channel at EU.org: free domain names - http://eu.org ?
21:42 melodie you don't get a domain for a channel, but you get one for a website,
21:43 melodie and they also suggest strongly to take other subdomaines from eu.org : us.eu.org, int.eu.org ...
