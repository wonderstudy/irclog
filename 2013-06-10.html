13:49 melodie   hi
16:23 melodie   hello soulshake !
22:19 pdurbin_m melodie: what's new?
22:26 pdurbin_m or anyone. the quiet ones. :)
22:27 pdurbin_m I'm improving my workflow for http://wiki.greptilian.com/java/javaone/2012
22:27 melodie   pdurbin_m was watching a video
22:27 melodie   you are not working all the time, are you?
22:30 pdurbin_m does taking care of kids count as work?
22:31 melodie   that counts as something very special: no one pays you for that, and it's exhausting, but you see your own ones growing. :)
22:32 pdurbin_m yeah
22:32 melodie   I may have an idea, but it might not be the one you would like the best, about this part:
22:32 melodie   "The rise of mobile and the diversity of its technologies make exposing a RESTful API the most crucial capability of any application and the key to its success. "
22:33 melodie   simple answer: pull the plug off, (or the battery! ^^)
22:33 pdurbin_m but as far as study... I'm pretty focused on Java EE
22:33 melodie   sorry, what does "EE" stand for?
22:33 pdurbin_m enterprise edition
22:40 melodie   ok
22:40 pdurbin_m I think I'd like to study music too
22:40 melodie   do you have knowledge in music?
22:41 melodie   I mean prior knowledge
22:42 pdurbin_m a little
22:44 pdurbin_m more than my knowledge of French :)
22:46 melodie   no one can know everything, right? I have no knowledge of music. I can't even read a classical musical arrangement
22:51 pdurbin_m any interest in it? reading music?
22:52 melodie   I would have, when I was younger
22:55 melodie   ubitux if you are here, I have something I would want to show you
22:56 pdurbin_m how about playing music? most guitarists can't read it ;)
22:57 ubitux    melodie: yes?
22:58 melodie   ubitux I posted a link to a specialized blog and to a video on the linuxvillage forum, I get the link
22:58 melodie   Re : Japon+France = â™¥ - http://linuxvillage.net/index.php/topic,395.msg2715.html#new
22:59 ubitux    is that worth watching?
22:59 ubitux    i wouldn't mind if it was 5-10 minutes, but it's a bit long
23:00 melodie   I watched the beginning and then listened to the rest while doing something else. It's mostly talking
23:00 melodie   however there is the link to the original blog, so I thought you might like it
23:03 ubitux    ok
23:03 ubitux    well, thx
23:04 melodie   with pleasure
23:18 melodie   good night
