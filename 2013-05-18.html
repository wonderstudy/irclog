00:34 melodie     hello !
00:39 melodie     good night
00:45 pdurbin     heh
00:46 pdurbin     so, all of these nice people joined: codex Darkos80 Goodbox irclogbot_sc martinux_qc melodie NoNa OpTimus rumpelstillskin run4flat slystone soulshake TechDesk znk_
00:46 pdurbin     then I asked them to leave because no one was an op or could become an op. so I re-created the channel and registered it this time
00:47 pdurbin     but now I need to invite everyone back! :)
00:56 pdurbin     ok, I think I was able to send a /msg to everyone except Darkos80 NoNa OpTimus rumpelstillskin znk_
00:56 pdurbin     martinux_qc: welcome back! you got the /msg, obviously :)
00:57 pdurbin     so sorry for the trouble :(
00:57 martinux_qc no problem, that ok
00:57 pdurbin     Goodbox: welcome!
00:57 Goodbox     Hi :) thank's !
00:58 martinux_qc so everything is ok now
00:59 Goodbox     rhaaa 02:58 o'clock x)
01:09 pdurbin     yep
06:34 slystone    \o/
07:17 Goodbox     Hey slystone :)
07:26 slystone    Hey Goodbox
11:52 pdurbin     soulshake: welcome! I'm glad you found something interesting in a different channel I started: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2013-05-17#i_7083840 :)
11:53 pdurbin     slystone: welcome to you too. do you know much about giving ChanServ admin rights? http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2013-05-18#i_7085017 I noticed that ChanServ hangs out in #linuxvillage
12:03 slystone    pdurbin: what do you want to do?
12:03 slystone    And thank you. :)
12:04 pdurbin     I'm not sure what I want to do... "setup ChanServ with some admin rights" is what melodie suggested
12:04 pdurbin     `/msg chanserv help set guard` shows me: "SET GUARD allows you to have ChanServ join your channel"
12:05 pdurbin     and once ChanServ has joined... I guess I would give her some admin rights? but I'm not sure which ones...
12:06 slystone    Try /msg ChanServ set #wonderstudy guard on
12:11 slystone    pdurbin: http://richard.esplins.org/siwi/2011/07/08/getting-started-freenode-irc/ ← you've got some help here. Otherwise you can always join #freenode to ask for some help.
12:12 slystone    pdurbin: you can give her all the rights, except the one to founder.
12:12 slystone    That's what I did on another chan.
12:13 slystone    http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml ← the different rights are listed here.
12:37 pdurbin     hmm. multiple founders are possible. this looks great. thanks
12:37 slystone    ^^
12:37 pdurbin     I have to run... soccer, ballet, ocean, birthday party. and tomorrow... bike parade
12:38 slystone    Seems like you've got a full schedule for the weekend. :)
12:38 pdurbin     yep
12:38 pdurbin     basically, I want to continue this post: http://crimsonfu.github.io/2012/02/06/crimsonfu-freenode-irc-channel-setup.html
12:38 pdurbin     and start talking about founders and chanserv
12:39 slystone    :)
12:39 slystone    Me I'm rollerblading to Paris to join an Englsh conversation table, and after I'll meet some anarchists.
12:50 Goodbox     Some anarchists :o Hi/re * :)
14:54 pdurbin     slystone: real anarchists? I'm not even sure what that means. :)
18:36 melodie     hello !
20:55 sebbu       I think I have some links for the conference / podcast section of the site :p
21:00 melodie     hi sebbu
21:01 melodie     do you want to add it to the github wonderstudy page ?
21:01 melodie     pdurbin do you intend to add some configuration to the present chan during the coming week ?
21:03 sebbu       melodie, yes
21:03 sebbu       should i fork &amp; make a pull request ?
21:03 melodie     yes you can
21:03 melodie     pdurbin said "welcome to fork" when it was started
21:04 melodie     https://github.com/wonderstudy/wonderstudy.github.io/blob/master/index.md
21:04 melodie     this is the file
22:39 slystone    pdurbin: well, it's very hard to be a real anarchist.
22:53 pdurbin_m   slystone: :)
22:53 pdurbin_m   slystone: how are the anarchists?
22:54 pdurbin_m   sebbu: fork away!
22:56 pdurbin_m   I walked around the marathon bombing site today. everything seemed very normal
23:00 pdurbin_m   sebbu: I am starting to think the recommendations should be organized by person. by whoever is recommending a podcast or course.
23:00 pdurbin_m   or at least tagged with names of people
23:01 sebbu       pdurbin, I'll fork soon
23:01 sebbu       by person it'll be hard
23:04 slystone    pdurbin_m: I didn't get to meet them in the end, I've spent too much time at the English conversation table.
23:04 pdurbin_m   yeah
23:05 slystone    o/ sebbu
23:07 pdurbin_m   bummer
23:08 slystone    Yep!
23:08 slystone    http://www.solutionslinux.fr/?lg=en ← next week I get to go this! \o/
23:10 slystone    The main sponsor is (you're going to laugh) Microsoft! But every year they get to have pranks played on them. ^^
23:17 sebbu       done
23:18 sebbu       It created an issue too :o
23:20 pdurbin     slystone: hmm. that reminds me... I have some French speaking friends in Montreal who have a Linux company: http://www.inverse.ca/francais.html
23:24 slystone    pdurbin: interesting! :)
23:24 slystone    Montreal ♥ Rho, now I want a Poutine!
23:32 * pdurbin   looks at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine
23:32 pdurbin     yum
23:55 slystone    ^^
