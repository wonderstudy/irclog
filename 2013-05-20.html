14:41 melodie  hello
19:17 melodie  ah !
19:17 melodie  there had to be a mean
19:29 sebbu    ?
19:36 pdurbin  meaning?
19:51 melodie  pdurbin I was seeking how to be voiced while deop-ed
19:51 melodie  I finally found how to do it
19:52 melodie  hi btw :)
20:15 sebbu    melodie, any higher right overwrite the lower one
20:16 sebbu    +o &gt; +h &gt; +v
20:16 sebbu    +a &amp; +q are special cases
20:16 sebbu    (but they need +o)
20:16 melodie  sebbu I just needed to be op again to be able to voice myself then deop
20:17 melodie  just a matter of doing things in the right order
20:25 sebbu    or you can just /cs #wonderstudy voice
20:25 sebbu    /cs voice #wonderstudy
20:25 sebbu    mieux
20:25 sebbu    ;)
20:26 sebbu    !devoice
20:26 sebbu    /cs devoice #wonderstudy
20:27 TechDesk hi all
20:28 pdurbin  yesterday I noticed that people in this channel don't need to be voiced for others to be able to see what they are typing (or for philbot to log what they typed). I'm confused why we even care if people are voiced or not
20:30 melodie  pdurbin if a spammer comes just type this: /mode +m
20:31 melodie  then only the persons who are already voiced can continue talking
20:31 pdurbin  ah. interesting!
20:31 melodie  later when the spammer leaves, you can do "/mode -m"
20:31 melodie  so that if someone who is not a spammer, but not yet known can talk
20:32 melodie  and then we voice only the persons who we can reasonably trust to be ok, polite, helpful, good guys and gals.
20:58 pdurbin  ok. sounds good
21:00 melodie  pdurbin this may also avoid having to limit the access to people invited
21:01 pdurbin  oh, we definitely don't want to limit access. I don't think!
21:01 pdurbin  the more the merrier :)
21:02 melodie  :)
21:02 melodie  sure
