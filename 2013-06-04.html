11:01 pdurbin   huh
19:59 melodie   hello
22:31 pydsigner I see you finally got the channel back :)
22:38 melodie   hi pydsigner
22:38 melodie   was it out and when?
22:44 pydsigner At the beginning, when there was the net.split
22:56 pdurbin   phew!
22:56 pdurbin   :)
22:56 melodie   oh yes, sure it has taken a pair of days to regain the control, but finally pdurbin has solved it
22:56 pdurbin   pydsigner: welcome back :)
22:58 pydsigner Thank you :)
22:58 pydsigner BTW, I don't think you have to +v yourself again
22:59 pydsigner The +o just masks the +v
22:59 melodie   pydsigner I don't really know because I have a +V and not +v so...
22:59 melodie   not sure what the best way is
23:00 melodie   when I deop I am not voiced
23:23 pdurbin   all I know is... I fixed my weechat so I'm no longer annoyed by the changes melodie made :)
23:23 melodie   pdurbin explain?
23:24 melodie   I don't do any change that can affect your use of the chan...
23:24 melodie   whatever can your client be or your configuration
23:40 melodie   good night
