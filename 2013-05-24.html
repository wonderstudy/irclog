00:24 ubitux  pdurbin: this 20 hours really sounds like pure bullshit TBH
00:24 ubitux  reminds me the books like "learn how to build an airplane in only 1 week"
00:25 ubitux  there is no secret to learning, you need time, no matter what those mountebanks want to make you believe
00:26 ubitux  and btw, the 10.000 hours sound pretty optimist for a mastery level
00:26 ubitux  it's more like between 5 and 10 years, not 3
00:27 ubitux  about the girl learning random stuff and making a 5 minutes video... well...
00:27 ubitux  that's nice but not digging a little more is IMO a waste of time
00:28 ubitux  learning superficially like this is well, interesting from a cultural PoV, but it doesn't provide much more insight that reading a random newspaper
00:37 pdurbin I watched the first few minutes of it but my internet disconnected or something. I wasn't exactly hanging on his every word. he was talking about how much your life changes when you have kids
00:38 pdurbin anyway, I more wanted to point out the learningnerd lady. I like her google+ posts in general
